# star-map-generator

Amateur and professional astronomers use star maps as a guide in finding the locations of 
stars, planets, and other celestial objects for observation.  This class project will be to 
produce a software system which will create on screen displays and printable star maps for 
observers at any location on the earth for a given date and time.
